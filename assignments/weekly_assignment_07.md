# Weekly Assignment 7

### Due Friday 10/26 at 2:00pm

Finish parsing and cleaning the rest of the data in your assigned "zone" (the zone that corresponds with the last digit of your student ID number) and at least one other zone, and update/replace your PostgreSQL table(s) with the new data. 

### Part One

*For the zone you were assigned:*  
Go back to the raw file you collected in Weekly Assignment 1 and finish parsing the rest of the file (that you started in Weekly Assignment 2). Parse and clean **all** relevant data that you will need to map and display the AA meetings for your zone. Make sure everything is geocoded (Weekly Assignment 3) and replace the table(s) you wrote in Weekly Assignment 4 with the new, complete (and **cleaned!**) data. 

For this assignment, you must have parsed/cleaned **all ten zones**, but you are encouraged to work in groups no larger than five people, with each person parsing at least two zones. Guidance on the next zone your should parse and clean:  

| Zone you were assigned: | Also parse and clean zone: |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 9 |
| 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 2 |
| 6 | 10 |
| 7 | 8 |
| 8 | 7 |
| 9 | 3 |
| 10 | 6 |

If you decide not to work in groups (or to work in smaller groups), then as an individual or group you must parse/clean all of the zones. (For example, if you work alone, you will parse/clean all ten zones; if you work in a group of 2, you must each parse/clean 5 zones.) Groups are encouraged to share code, but **every group member must make an equal contribution to the work**. 

## Submission requirements
