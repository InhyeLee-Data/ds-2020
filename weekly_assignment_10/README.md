# Weekly Assignment 10

### Due Monday, 11/18 at 6:00pm

Using the work from all of your previous weekly assignments, you will create a web server application in Node.js that will respond to various requests for JSON data for AA meetings, process blog entries, and sensor readings, ideally aggregated in some way. These requests will provide the data that would be needed to create a visual representation of the data, in the format that is needed. The data should come from the result of a database query; I encourage you to query for an aggregation that would match your designed visual representation for the final assignments (the work you are doing in [Weekly Assignment 11](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/weekly_assignment_11.md)). 

Your app should include:  

* A landing page, with references to the three pages detailed below.  
* A page that shows some AA data.  
* A page that shows some process blog data.  
* A page that shows some sensor data.

Here's an example of a working application:  
[**http://35.173.238.184:8080/**](http://35.173.238.184:8080/)

This application is running in my Cloud9 environment (launched with PM2), which required following [these instructions to share a running Cloud9 application over the internet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/app-preview.html?icmpid=docs_ac9_ide#app-preview-share). 

## Starter Code

I have extensive starter code that I will share if requested. However, I strongly encourage you to complete this assignment without starter code (except for the basic starter code in this directory showing a barebones Express application), drawing on your work on all previous assignments. 

### Submission requirements

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
