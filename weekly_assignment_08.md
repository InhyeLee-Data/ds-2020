# Weekly Assignment 8

### Due Friday 11/9 at 2:00pm

Switching gears from previous assignments, we will be working with temperature [**sensors**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4089). 

Various supplies are available to you in locker **M** on the 4th Floor of 2 W 13th Street (across from the bathrooms nearest to 404). The combination for the locker is `30-00-22`. Everything you could possibly need is in this locker. 

# Setup

1. Complete steps 1 and 2A in the Particle [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/).  
2. Familiarize yourself with the [Console](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/console/). Log into [the Console](https://console.particle.io/) and verify that your device is listed. Make note of your *Device ID*.   
3. Familiarize yourself with the [Web IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/). Log into [the Web IDE](https://build.particle.io/) and go through the 'Blink an LED' example app.  
4. In the Web IDE under 'Settings,' retrieve and make note of your *Access Token*.  
5. Familiarize yourself with [Particle Variables](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#particle-variable-).  
6. Set up your sensor. It should look like this:
